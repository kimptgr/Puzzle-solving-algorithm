# Puzzle Solvers

Scripts to solve selected puzzles from the game *Layton's Mystery Journey*.

These are custom algorithmic solutions written from scratch, for the purpose of practicing and demonstrating logic, backtracking, and combinatorial optimization techniques.

## Techniques Used

- **Backtracking**  
  Recursive functions using:
  - base case checks,
  - loops to explore available options,
  - recursive calls,
  - and backtracking (undo) steps.

- **Early Pruning**  
  Quickly discarding invalid paths to reduce computation time.

- **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)**  
  Prioritizing variables with the fewest legal values to improve backtracking efficiency.

- **Forward Checking**  
  Anticipating the consequences of each choice to avoid future dead-ends.
